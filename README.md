# This is a parser that supports VDS data written in "C"
This data format is old, but the opensource of this as it can be modified to perform other tasks
as the parser itself is quite plugable for 20 year code.

This code was written by Bill Harper as a trouble shooting tool for the SE's and them adopted by the Xerox
engineering team and added to the product base line as an output analyizer, a tool much needed.

Purpose:
This tool reads graphics data (binary) an prints out an analysis in full or summary view.  It handles all VDS formats including VRF, VDS Raster (1D, 2D 2D Optimized) and blocked raster.
